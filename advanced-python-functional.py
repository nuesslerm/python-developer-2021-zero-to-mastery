# what is functional programming?
# separation of data and functions
# emphasis on simplicity where data and functions are concerned
# functions operate on well-defined data structures rather than assigning the data structure to an object
# general goals:
# clear + understandable
# easy to extend
# easy to maintain
# memory efficient
# DRY

# pure functions
